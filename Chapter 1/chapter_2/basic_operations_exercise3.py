#What does the following code do? Why?

print('5' + '10')

#This code prints 510, because '5' and '10' are both strings, so it uses string concatenation.

#When used with string operands, + performs concatenation and returns a new string.

#question 4: Refactor the code from the previous exercise to use coercion to print 15 instead.
print(int('5') + int('10'))
